# Mecha

Choose your character’s profession: 

+ SECURITY: Exo-Rig with 1× GORGON part. 
+ RESCUE: Exo-Rig with 1× EAGLE part. 
+ HEAVY: Exo-Rig with 1× RHINO part. 
+ TECH: Exo-Rig with 1× MANTIS part. 
+ COURIER: Exo-Rig with 1× LYNX part. 
+ MEDIC: Exo-Rig with 1× CHIRON part. 

You can equip up to four pieces of Exo-Rig gear  – one piece to ARMS, LEGS, CORE, and HEAD. 

Indicated next to each type of gear is the skill it  gives you. The skills listed here, and all similar  physical skills, or skills requiring specialist  equipment, cannot be attempted unless you  equip the relevant gear. Equipping one piece  means you can roll a d6 to use that skill,  equipping two gives a d8, three pieces gives a  d10, and equipping all four pieces gives a d12. 

Buy from nano-lab for listed $SCRAP per piece; or (GM) roll one d6 to equip a Humanoid enemy. 

Anyone can repair broken gear at a nano-lab for half its $CRAP value, rounded down. 

LEVEL 1 - 3$CRAP 
1. LYNX: Dodge & sprint 
2. GORGON: Control security devices 
3. EAGLE: Cut & clear a path

Revive everything nearby 
Unleash explosive force 
Additional +1$CRAP per hit

Most enemies also have parts – ARMS, LEGS, CORE and HEAD – and carry weapons. 

When you attack an enemy, choose to either just reduce it to $CRAP, or target its parts to disable  it and/or farm its gear/weapons (no $CRAP). 

Each enemy has a level equal to: successful hits  needed to reduce them to $CRAP; distinct parts  to damage to totally disable them; and amount of $CRAP they give (all players) on death. 

A player’s captured $CRAP is returned to the  player who lost it when that enemy is defeated.

# Talents



# VR Exploits

Choose 1 exploit — how you bend the simulation to your will. To use an exploit, roll Simulation (d6 skill by default), at the risk of alerting daemons (1–2) nearby or (3–4) within a block.

To enhance a risky action with an exploit(e.g., Shift bullets while Shooting; Move by Running on a wall), roll Simulation and the other skill; use the higher die. If not already engaged by daemons, replace the roll’s risk with “alerting daemons.”

+ BREAK: Strike with piercing force — shatter a tree trunk, punch through a car door, etc.
+ COPY: Duplicate a small object. Hinder(d4) for something bigger than you, up to car-sized.
+ CHOWN: An item you specify is recognized as yours, legally and in public opinion. (The previous owner might pretend otherwise.)
+ DELETE: A small item you touch ceases to exist — a gun, a doorknob, a laptop, etc.
+ FIND: Unerringly locate an item, either general (“a gun”) or specific (“this door’s key”).
+ KILL: Touch to induce cardiac arrest. No effect on daemons. Being seen using this will turn many principled codebreakers against you.
+ HIDE: People ignore you as long as you can hold your breath. Daemons fooled only briefly.
+ MOVE: Move with preternatural speed and grace — jump across rooftops, scale walls, etc.
+ PING: Sense everything around you, as if by radar. Helps when someone sneaks up on you.
+ RESTORE: Reveal an injury is not as bad as it looked, removing a hindrance.
+ SHIFT: Momentarily exert invisible force on an object — bend a spoon, guide a bullet, etc.
+ SUDO: Force an object to perform or cease its function — stall an engine, unlock a door, etc.
+ SUSPEND: Gently pause someone a short while, as if entranced. No effect on daemons.

> VR Exploits are based on _The Matrix_ films.

Examples:

+ I hid a backup piece in my pant leg.

# Disuigse

> Offer some names that make sense in your  setting. You can add a table for how the character 
appears, or clothing or unusual items. Help the players enter the world through their character.
>
> Below is a different type of table. Rolling two dice and adding them together creates what is called  a bell curve, where middle results are more likely than those at 2 or 12. By rolling one dice then another, and looking up the numbers separately, each entry has an equal chance.

# Rules



# Rules

HAZARDS: When characters are cautious and alert, the GM is generous with information about
hazards (“The dirt looks freshly swept over,” or even, “You spot a pit trap”). Characters only risk harm from unseen hazards when in a rush. which the GM signals as a risk (“You can flee, but you risk an enemy pursuing — or running into a trap”).

STEPS: If a situation can’t be resolved in 1 roll...
+ Establish actions & risks as you normally do. There’s no rigid turn order, but strive to give every player a chance to be in the spotlight.
+ Each player rolls as needed. Actions might go in sequence (“disarm, then attack!”), or all at once (“grab the guns while I hold them off!”).
+ Evaluate the results as you normally do, with a focus on how the situation changes.
+ Repeat until situation is resolved or escaped.

RULINGS: The GM improvises rulings when rules
are unclear. On a break, discuss unsatisfactory
rulings, maybe to retcon or revise for next time.

# Danger

RISK-SETTING: The GM doesn’t plan solutions for problems. Instead, they advise of risks before players roll, and improvise what happens next based on what players do and what the dice say. When presenting risks, the GM should consider...

+ The worst-case scenario: If playing Battle Moon like a Saturday morning cartoon, the worst case scenario of “trying to punch out a killer robot” is getting hurt. In a sci-fi/horror game, the worst case would be death. If players revise plans, the GM signals a new worst-case scenario. “I run by to distract the robot” might only risk getting cornered.
+ On a “miss”: If an attack goes wide, the real risk is what changes — out of ammo, jammed gun, gave away position, drew fire, etc. If you can just try again without issue, it’s not a risk.
+ If you forget: If someone rolls a 1–4, but the risk wasn’t made explicit, the GM describes logical consequences given already signaled details — no surprises. Death and permanent injury are off-limits if these weren’t already unambiguously established as risks.

CONSEQUENCES: Assigning risks is meant to be intuitive, based on context, not a pick-list. That said, if players need help coming up with more modest goals than “shoot to kill,” or if the GM struggles to describe new risks after players revise their goals and tactics, look lower on this list for examples of shorter-term risks.

+ Permanent: dead, maimed, item lost forever
+ Days or weeks: wounded, broken bone or item
+ Minutes or hours: dizzy, sore, exhausted
+ Brief: tripped, distracted, exposed, disarmed

DEFENSE: When a character would be harmed, a player may declare an item or cyber-limb broken to suffer only a brief hindrance (like stumbling) instead. Broken items are useless until repaired.

DEATH: If a player’s character dies, introduce a new one (or take over one the GM doesn’t need) ASAP. Favor quick inclusion over realism.

# 24XX SYSTEM REFERENCE DOCUMENT (SRD)

Version 1.41

Text CC BY Jason Tocci

## RULES

Play: Players describe what their characters do. The GM advises when their action is impossible, demands a cost or extra steps, or presents a risk. Players can revise plans before committing so as to change goal/stakes. Only roll to avoid risk.

Rolling: Roll a skill die — d6 by default, higher with a relevant skill, or d4 if hindered by injury or circumstances. If helped by circumstances, roll an extra d6; if helped by an ally, they roll their skill die and share the risk. Take the highest die.

1–2	Disaster. Suffer the full risk. GM decides if you succeed at all. If risking death, you die.
3–4	Setback. A lesser consequence or partial success. If risking death, you’re injured.
5+	Success. The higher the roll, the better.

If success can’t get you what you want (you make the shot, but it’s bulletproof!), you’ll at least get useful info or set up an advantage.

Load: Carry as much as makes sense, but more than one bulky item may hinder you at times.

Advancement: After a job, each character increases a skill (none⮕d8⮕d10⮕d12) and gains d6 credits (₡).

Defense: Say how one of your items breaks to turn a hit into a brief hindrance. Broken gear is useless until repaired.

Harm: Injuries take time and/or medical attention to heal. If killed, make a new character to introduce ASAP. Favor inclusion over realism.

GM: Describe characters in terms of behaviors, risks, and obstacles, not skill dice. Lead the group in setting lines not to cross in play. Fast-forward, pause, or rewind/redo for pacing and safety; invite players to do likewise. Present dilemmas you don’t know how to solve. Move spotlight to give all time to shine. Test as needed for bad luck (e.g., run out of ammo, or into guards) — roll a die to check for (1– 2) trouble or (3–4) signs of it. Improvise rulings to cover gaps in rules; on a break, revise unsatisfactory rulings as a group.

## CHARACTERS

> SRD design notes are in sidebars, like this. Other paragraphs are player/GM-facing text.

> THE PREMISE: Explain the basics of the setting. If it’s not made clear elsewhere, give a reason for the characters to stick together, and hint at what they’ll spend their time doing.

> THE BACK PAGE: If you’d like to mimic the style of the original micro RPGs this SRD is based on, the back page (or the left half of one side of a letter-sized sheet of paper) can fit 4 tables of 20 items each. A GM can use these to generate ideas for an improvised session, like, “[Name] has hired you for [Job] at [Location], but there’s a [Twist]!” An example table is offered below. 

> ADDING TO RULES: This SRD is very brief, with the hope experienced RPG players will fill in the gaps confidently, and RPG newcomers will be free of too many preconceived notions. Anything left vague is deliberately open to interpretation. (Like: Can you get help dice from an ally AND circumstances on one roll? Your call!) Expand or clarify as needed. My own principles for new rules are to minimize addition and subtraction, avoid too much bookkeeping (on top of tracking credits, hindrances, number of bulky items, and which items are broken), and strive to use terms either self-evident in meaning or invitingly vague.

18.	Walleye, businesslike information broker
19.	Whistler, smiling cabbie/getaway driver
20.	“X,” unflappable broker for an unnamed corp


> FINDING JOBS: Many teams don’t need to look for paying work (e.g., military units). If your game does use this setup, though, dangerous jobs should pay more to cover 1–3 credits in “expenses” for medical treatment, fixing/replacing broken gear, re-rolling unsavory jobs, or getting through dry spells with no jobs. Also, in the table above, the phrase “owe somebody” is intentionally vague, but may be worth clarifying or alluding to elsewhere (e.g., put a loan shark in your “Contacts” table).
>
> JOBS: The list of jobs (or missions, situations, quests, etc.) should be tailored for your setting, and suggest scenarios where every character’s skills will be useful. Common job templates include “deal with an unusual threat,” “investigate something seemingly inexplicable,” or “retrieve a thing from a location for a person.” They serve as “gameable lore” — elements that hint at a setting, ready-made for use in play.

Roll d6 to try to find a job. Spend ₡1 to re-roll.

+ 1–2	Nothing. Owe somebody to get in on a job.
+ 3–4	Found a job, but something seems off.
+ 5–6	Choose between 2 jobs.

# GM Information



# Artifacts

Artifacts are small, unstable, single-use alien and/or ancient devices — inspired by combining 2 words from the lists below. The exact function is up to the GM to interpret, but player suggestions are encouraged. (These lists can also inspire stable exotic artifacts, but players don’t start with any.)

IDENTIFICATION: You recognize items on sight as artifacts. When you try to determine what they do, you risk (1–2) accidental activation or (3–4) only getting a vague sense of function. Rolling again yields no further information.

INSTABILITY: When you risk harm while carrying 4 or more xot, the roll also indicates whether your xot activate or act unpredictably (1–2) at once or (3–4) with just enough warning to throw them. Xot litter the world. They are powerful and dangerous to hoard. Use or trade them often.

ARTIFACT USE: When you use an exotic artifact in a risky situation, the roll also indicates whether it is depleted (1–2) already, or (3–4) after this use.

TRADE: 1 xot is worth 1 useful tool or weapon, or 1 bulky scrap bundle. Artifacts are worth 10+ xot.

# Opponents

OPPONENTS: The GM doesn’t roll skill dice. Instead, they describe characters based on...

+ Behavior: What do they do to get what they want? Beasts just want to eat, sleep, reproduce, protect themselves, and maybe protect their mates and their young. Sapient beings have more complex drives. Not everyone just wants to kill you.
+ Risks: If the players come in conflict with this character, what do the players risk? (Maybe they’ve got a knife, or it’s big enough to kill you just by stepping on you.) The GM should signal this when introducing a potential opponent, before anyone initiates conflict. If conflict would risk nothing (an unwary, vulnerable, isolated target), players don’t roll.
+ Obstacles: Would anything prevent players from overcoming this opponent in one roll? As above, the GM signals this before players roll. (You need to find a way through their armor first, or there’s too many to take on alone.) If there are no obstacles, an opponent — even a group — can be defeated in one roll.

Example: This boss has 5 steps

RESHKIGAL: Airlock warning: No weapons permitted in metamind chamber. (Tools OK.)

+ Entry is at its eye-level; target of gaze risks death by laser.
+ Leap to its shoulder (risk death by fall)
+ climb behind head
+ sever cable 1
+ sever cable 2
